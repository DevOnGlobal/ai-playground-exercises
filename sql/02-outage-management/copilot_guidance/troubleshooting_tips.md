# Troubleshooting Tips for GitHub Copilot in SQL Development

Working with GitHub Copilot can significantly boost your productivity, but like any AI tool, it sometimes requires guidance and troubleshooting. Here are common issues and tips for resolving them, specifically for SQL development.

## 1. Copilot Generates Incorrect or Irrelevant SQL

**Issue**: Copilot provides SQL that doesn't match your intent, uses incorrect table/column names, or is syntactically wrong for your SQL dialect (e.g., MySQL).

**Tips**:
*   **Be More Specific in Comments**: The more precise your comments, the better Copilot's suggestions will be. Include:
    *   Exact table and column names.
    *   Specific business rules or formulas.
    *   Desired output columns and their data types.
    *   The SQL dialect you are using (e.g., `-- MySQL`).
    *   Example: `-- TODO: Create a view that shows all active incidents (status IN ('DETECTED', 'ASSIGNED', 'IN_PROGRESS')) from the outage_incidents table, including incident_id, created_time, and geographic_lat.`
*   **Provide Context**: Ensure Copilot has enough surrounding code or comments to understand the context. If you're working on a complex query, break it down into smaller CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and prompt for each part.
*   **Use Domain-Specific Terminology**: Employ terms from the Power Outage Management domain (e.g., `SAIDI`, `SAIFI`, `critical infrastructure`, `crew specialization`). This helps Copilot align with the problem space.
*   **Iterate and Refine**: Don't expect perfect code on the first try. Accept a suggestion, then add more comments or modify the code slightly to guide Copilot towards the correct solution.
*   **Check for Typos**: Even small typos in your comments or existing code can throw Copilot off.

## 2. Copilot is Not Suggesting Anything

**Issue**: Copilot is not providing any suggestions, or suggestions are very generic.

**Tips**:
*   **Ensure Copilot is Active**: Check your IDE/editor status bar to confirm Copilot is enabled and connected.
*   **Trigger Manually**: Sometimes, you might need to manually trigger Copilot suggestions (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd+Enter` in some IDEs).
*   **Add More Context**: Start typing a comment or a partial SQL statement. Copilot often needs a starting point.
*   **Restart IDE/Copilot**: A simple restart of your IDE or the Copilot extension can resolve temporary glitches.
*   **Check Internet Connection**: Copilot requires an active internet connection to function.

## 3. Copilot Generates Inefficient Queries

**Issue**: The generated SQL works, but it's slow or not optimized.

**Tips**:
*   **Prompt for Performance**: Explicitly ask Copilot to optimize. Example: `-- TODO: Create an optimized query to find incidents affecting critical customers. Ensure it uses appropriate indexes.`
*   **Suggest Indexes**: If you know certain columns should be indexed for performance, mention them in comments. Example: `-- Consider adding an index on outage_incidents.created_time for faster date range queries.`
*   **Break Down Complex Joins**: Guide Copilot to use CTEs for multi-step joins or aggregations, which can sometimes lead to more readable and performant queries.
*   **Use `EXPLAIN`**: Run `EXPLAIN` on Copilot-generated queries to understand their execution plan. Then, use the insights to refine your prompts or manually optimize the query.

## 4. Handling Stored Procedures and Functions

**Issue**: Copilot struggles with the `DELIMITER` syntax or complex stored procedure logic.

**Tips**:
*   **Provide `DELIMITER` Context**: Always include the `DELIMITER //` and `DELIMITER ;` lines around your stored procedure/function definition. Copilot learns from this pattern.
*   **Step-by-Step Implementation**: For long procedures, define the procedure signature first, then add comments for each logical block (e.g., `DECLARE` variables, `SELECT` statements, `IF/ELSE` logic). Prompt for each block individually.
*   **Specify Parameters and Variables**: Clearly define `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT` parameters and `DECLARE` local variables with their types.

## 5. When to Accept vs. Refine AI Suggestions

*   **Accept**: When the suggestion is exactly what you need, or requires only minor tweaks (e.g., changing a column alias).
*   **Refine**: When the suggestion is close but not perfect. Add more guiding comments, delete parts of the suggestion, or type a few characters to steer Copilot in the right direction.
*   **Discard**: When the suggestion is completely off-topic or fundamentally incorrect. Delete it and re-prompt with a clearer instruction.

Remember, GitHub Copilot is a powerful assistant, but it's not a replacement for understanding SQL and your database schema. Use it to accelerate your development, but always review and validate its suggestions.
