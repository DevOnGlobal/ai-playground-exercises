# Power Outage Management System - GitHub Copilot Exercise

## Overview
This exercise guides you through building a Python-based power outage management system, focusing on incident tracking, crew dispatch, customer notification, and restoration planning. The primary goal is to enhance your **AI collaboration skills** using GitHub Copilot, rather than deep domain expertise in energy distribution.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- Design and implement complex data structures for crisis management.
- Develop business logic for resource optimization and decision-making.
- Create data processing pipelines using Python's built-in capabilities.
- Utilize advanced GitHub Copilot prompting techniques for business scenario implementation.
- Generate reports and analytics without external dependencies.

## Setup Instructions
1.  **Clone this repository** (if you haven't already).
2.  **Navigate to the exercise directory**:
    ```bash
    cd power-outage-management
    ```
3.  **Create a Python virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    -   **Windows**: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    -   **macOS/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`
5.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6.  **Open the project in your IDE** (e.g., VS Code) with GitHub Copilot enabled.

## Exercise Tasks
Refer to the `SOLUTION_CHECKPOINTS.md` for detailed tasks and success criteria.

## Running the Simulation
Once you've completed the tasks, you can run the `main.py` simulation:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Troubleshooting
Refer to `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common issues and solutions.

## Good Luck!
Focus on how you prompt Copilot to achieve the desired outcomes. Experiment with different phrasing, provide clear business rules, and break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. Happy coding!
