# Exercise: Power Outage Management and Restoration System

## Overview
**Duration**: 50 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Domain**: Energy Distribution Network Software

## Learning Objectives
- Implement crisis management and workflow orchestration patterns
- Practice resource optimization under time pressure constraints  
- Build customer communication and stakeholder management systems
- Handle complex business scenarios with multiple dependencies
- Learn to provide clear data context for AI-assisted development in crisis scenarios

## Business Context
When power outages occur, utility companies need software to quickly identify affected areas, prioritize restoration efforts, dispatch field crews efficiently, and communicate with customers about expected restoration times.

## Setup Instructions
1.  **Clone the repository**: If you haven't already, clone the `copilot-exercises` repository.
2.  **Navigate to the exercise directory**: `cd C:/repos/copilot-exercises/typescript/power-outage-management_exercise/power-outage-management`
3.  **Install dependencies**: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
4.  **Compile TypeScript**: `npx tsc` (or `yarn tsc`)

## Task Structure
This exercise is divided into several tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of power outage management.

### Task 1: Outage Detection and Classification (10 minutes)
**Objective**: Build the foundation for outage incident management with clear data context
**Copilot Focus**: Generating class structure, method stubs, and basic business logic based on comments.

### Task 2: Crew Dispatch Optimization (12 minutes)
**Objective**: Implement intelligent crew assignment with multi-factor optimization
**Copilot Focus**: Implementing complex algorithms (e.g., Haversine formula), scoring functions, and workload balancing.

### Task 3: Restoration Planning with Dependencies (12 minutes)
**Objective**: Build complex restoration sequencing with realistic constraints
**Copilot Focus**: Handling dependencies, priority sorting, and realistic time estimations with multiple factors.

### Task 4: Customer Communication System (10 minutes)
**Objective**: Implement automated customer notifications with realistic delivery simulation
**Copilot Focus**: Generating personalized messages, simulating external interactions, and managing queues.

### Task 5: Emergency Response Coordination (6 minutes)
**Objective**: Handle critical scenarios and emergency escalation
**Copilot Focus**: Implementing escalation protocols, load shedding logic, and reporting.

## Getting Started
- Open the `power-outage-management_exercise/power-outage-management` directory in your IDE.
- Follow the instructions within each `// TODO` comment in the starter files.
- Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in writing the code. Provide clear and concise comments to guide Copilot.

## Copilot Best Practices for Crisis Management Software
- Use urgency and priority terminology in function and variable names.
- Describe realistic emergency scenarios with specific numbers and constraints.
- Include detailed business rules about customer prioritization and safety requirements.
- Structure code around emergency response procedures and escalation protocols.
- Write comments that explain utility industry standards and regulatory requirements.
- Use domain-specific crisis management terminology that reflects real-world emergency operations.

## Success Criteria
By the end of this exercise, you should have:
- ✅ Comprehensive outage detection and classification with realistic incident creation
- ✅ Intelligent crew dispatch algorithms considering multiple optimization factors
- ✅ Restoration planning with dependency management and customer prioritization
- ✅ Customer communication system with personalized messaging and delivery simulation
- ✅ Emergency response protocols for critical scenarios and large-scale outages
- ✅ Clear understanding of how to provide data context for AI-assisted crisis management software
- ✅ Practical experience with complex business workflows and resource optimization

## Troubleshooting
- If Copilot is not suggesting code, ensure your comments are clear and specific.
- Check for syntax errors in your existing code, as this can sometimes prevent Copilot from providing suggestions.
- If you're stuck, refer to the `copilot_guidance` directory for examples and tips.
