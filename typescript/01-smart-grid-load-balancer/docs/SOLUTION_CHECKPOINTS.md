# Smart Grid Load Balancer (TypeScript) â€“ Solution Checkpoints

This document provides validation steps and success criteria for each task in the TypeScript Smart Grid Load Balancer exercise. Use these checkpoints to verify your progress and ensure your implementations are correct.

## General Verification Steps

- **Run the Application**: After completing each task, run the main entry point (e.g., `npm start` or `ts-node src/index.ts`). Observe the console output for errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Check Logging Output**: Review `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` messages for insights into system operation and alert generation.
- **Review Generated Data**: If a task involves generating or modifying data, inspect the relevant files (e.g., CSV exports or JSON outputs).

## Task 1: Grid Infrastructure Data Models

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive TypeScript interfaces/classes for grid segments, power sources, and load measurements with appropriate validation.

**Success Criteria**:
- **GridSegment**:
    - `getUtilizationPercentage()` correctly calculates `(currentLoadMW / maxCapacityMW) * 100`.
    - `isApproachingCapacity()` returns `true` when utilization is `>= safetyThresholdPct`.
- **GridTopology**:
    - `getSegmentById()` retrieves a `GridSegment` by its ID.
- **PowerSource**:
    - Includes fields: `reliabilityScore`, `costPerMWh`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `operationalStatus`, `startupTimeMinutes`, `weatherDependent`.
    - `currentOutputMW` does not exceed `maxCapacityMW`.
    - `getCostPerHour()` calculates cost correctly.
    - `isRenewable()` identifies renewable sources.
- **LoadMeasurement**:
    - Correctly parses timestamp strings into `Date` objects.
    - `loadMW` is validated to be non-negative.

**Verification Steps**:
1. Run the main script and observe for type or runtime errors.
2. (Optional) Write unit tests or add print statements to instantiate models with various values (including invalid ones) and verify their behavior.

## Task 2: Data Loading Infrastructure

**Objective**: Implement robust data loading utilities with error handling.

**Success Criteria**:
- **DataLoader**:
    - `loadPowerSources()` reads `data/power_sources.json` and returns a list of `PowerSource` objects.
    - `loadMeasurementData()` reads `data/sample_load_data.csv`, parses timestamps, validates `loadMW` (non-negative), and returns a list of `LoadMeasurement` objects.
    - Both methods handle file errors (e.g., file not found, JSON parse errors, invalid data) gracefully.
    - `getCurrentGridState()` aggregates data from topology and power sources, and calculates system-wide metrics.

**Verification Steps**:
1. Run the main script and look for successful loading messages.
2. Temporarily introduce errors in the data files and verify that errors are handled gracefully (e.g., error messages, skipping invalid rows).

## Task 3: Load Balancing Business Logic

**Objective**: Implement core load balancing algorithms with clear data context.

**Success Criteria**:
- **LoadBalancer**:
    - `analyzeGridCapacity()` categorizes segments into 'healthy', 'warning', and 'critical' based on utilization (80% and 90% thresholds).
    - `calculateOptimalTransfers()` identifies critical segments and proposes transfers to healthy segments, considering `maxTransferMW` and `powerLossPct`.
    - `validateTransferFeasibility()` checks if a proposed transfer plan adheres to all constraints (no segment exceeds capacity, path capacity not exceeded).
    - `optimizePowerSourceDispatch()` prioritizes cheaper and renewable sources while meeting demand and maintaining reserve capacity.

**Verification Steps**:
1. Run the main script and observe output for segment status and transfer recommendations.
2. Modify `data/grid_topology.json` to create a critical scenario and verify that a transfer recommendation is generated.
3. (Advanced) Add print statements or unit tests to inspect intermediate calculations and ensure business rules are applied correctly.

## Task 4: Monitoring and Alerting System

**Objective**: Build real-time monitoring with alert generation.

**Success Criteria**:
- **MonitoringSystem**:
    - `generateCapacityAlerts()` creates alerts with appropriate `alertLevel` (WARNING, CRITICAL, EMERGENCY) based on segment utilization (80%, 90%, 95% thresholds).
    - `checkAllSegments()` integrates with the data loader and calls `generateCapacityAlerts()`.
    - Alerts are logged with `console.warn` and include segment ID, utilization, level, and recommended action.
    - `trackAlertHistory()` maintains a record of all generated alerts.
    - `createOperationalSummary()` provides an overview of grid status, including alert breakdown.

**Verification Steps**:
1. Run the main script and observe logging output for alert messages. Adjust `currentLoadMW` in `data/grid_topology.json` to trigger different alert levels.
2. Verify that the operational summary includes an accurate count of active alerts.

## Task 5: Data Analysis and Reporting

**Objective**: Generate operational reports using built-in TypeScript/Node.js capabilities.

**Success Criteria**:
- **GridReports**:
    - `generateDailyPerformanceSummary()` produces a well-formatted text report including system metrics, segment utilization, load pattern analysis, active alerts summary, and recommendations.
    - `calculateEfficiencyMetrics()` calculates overall grid utilization and (placeholder for) power loss.
    - `analyzePowerSourceUtilization()` summarizes utilization by source type.
    - `createCapacityTrendReport()` provides trend analysis.
    - `exportDataToCSV()` writes data to a CSV file with specified headers.

**Verification Steps**:
1. Run the main script and review the performance summary printed to the console.
2. (Optional) Call `exportDataToCSV()` with sample data and verify that a CSV file is created with correct content.
