# AI Playground Exercises

Welcome to the AI Playground Exercises repository! This collection contains hands-on, real-world coding exercises designed to demonstrate and practice AI-assisted software development using GitHub Copilot across multiple programming languages and domains.

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized into subdirectories by language and topic, including:

- **Python**: Data pipelines, smart grid load balancing, energy meter processing, and more.
- **TypeScript**: Power outage management, REST API development, React components.
- **SQL**: Database schema design, analytics, and optimization.
- **Cross-language**: Testing suites, security audits, and documentation generation.

Each exercise is structured to teach specific software engineering concepts, crisis management workflows, and best practices for leveraging AI tools in the SDLC.

- Each exercise contains:
  - `README.md` with objectives and setup
  - Starter code with `TODO` prompts for Copilot
  - `tests/` directory for validation
  - Sample data and documentation

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-playground-exercises
   ```

2. **Choose an exercise:**  
   Navigate to the relevant subdirectory (e.g., `python/01-load-balancing`).

3. **Follow the setup guide:**  
   Each exercise includes a `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` with environment and dependency instructions.

4. **Open in your IDE:**  
   Use an IDE with GitHub Copilot enabled (VS Code recommended).

5. **Complete the tasks:**  
   Follow the `TODO` comments and use Copilot to assist with implementation.

6. **Run tests:**  
   Each exercise provides a test suite to validate your solution.

## Best Practices

- Provide clear comments and context for Copilot to generate relevant code.
- Use test-driven development: run tests frequently as you implement features.
- Refer to the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for Copilot-specific guidance.
