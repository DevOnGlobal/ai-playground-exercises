# Exercise: Smart Grid Load Balancing System

## Exercise Overview
**Duration**: 50 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Domain**: Energy Distribution Network Software
**Technology Focus**: TypeScript

## Learning Objectives
- Practice writing descriptive comments to guide GitHub Copilot
- Build complex business logic types for critical infrastructure
- Implement real-time monitoring and alerting systems
- Handle constraint optimization in business scenarios
- Learn to provide clear data context for AI-assisted development

## Business Context
You're developing software for an electrical distribution company that needs to balance power loads across different grid segments while preventing overloads and optimizing energy flow from multiple sources (solar, wind, traditional power plants).

## Setup Instructions
1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
3.  **Run Tests**:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

## Task Structure
This exercise is divided into six tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of the smart grid system. You will be building the core logic for load balancing, emergency response, and monitoring.

1.  **Grid Infrastructure Modeling (10 minutes)**: Define the core data structures for the electrical grid.
2.  **Power Source Configuration (8 minutes)**: Model the different types of power sources.
3.  **Data Loading Infrastructure (10 minutes)**: Build the data access layer.
4.  **Load Balancing Algorithm (15 minutes)**: Implement the core load balancing logic.
5.  **Emergency Response System (10 minutes)**: Handle critical failure scenarios.
6.  **Real-time Monitoring & Alerts (7 minutes)**: Implement a system for monitoring and alerts.

## Getting Started
1.  Open the `smart-grid-load-balancer` directory.
2.  Follow the instructions in each task to complete the exercise.
3.  Use the provided `copilot_guidance` for tips on effective prompting.

## Copilot Best Practices
-   Use descriptive comments to explain business logic.
-   Provide concrete examples in your comments.
-   Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks.
-   Use meaningful variable and function names.

## Success Criteria
-   All tasks are completed.
-   The application runs without errors.
-   The load balancing algorithm correctly distributes power.
-   The emergency response system correctly prioritizes customers.
-   The monitoring system generates appropriate alerts.

## Troubleshooting
-   If you get stuck, refer to the `solutions` directory for the complete implementation.
-   If you are having trouble with a specific Copilot suggestion, try rephrasing your comment or adding more context.
