# Troubleshooting Tips

## Copilot Is Not Giving Good Suggestions

-   **Be more specific in your comments.** The more context you provide, the better Copilot's suggestions will be.
-   **Provide examples.** If you want Copilot to generate code that follows a certain pattern, provide an example of that pattern in your comments.
-   **Break down the problem.** If you are working on a complex problem, break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This will make it easier for Copilot to understand what you are trying to do.

## Copilot Is Giving Incorrect Suggestions

-   **Don't trust Copilot blindly.** Always review Copilot's suggestions carefully before accepting them.
-   **Use the debugger.** If you are not sure why a piece of code is not working, use the debugger to step through it and see what is happening.
-   **Ask Copilot to explain the code.** If you don't understand a piece of code that Copilot has generated, ask it to explain it to you.

## Copilot Is Slow

-   **Check your internet connection.** Copilot needs an internet connection to work.
-   **Restart your IDE.** Sometimes, restarting your IDE can fix performance issues.
-   **Check for updates.** Make sure you have the latest version of the Copilot extension installed.
