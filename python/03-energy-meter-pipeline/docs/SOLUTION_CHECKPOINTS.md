# Solution Checkpoints

Use these checkpoints to track your progress and ensure you are on the right path.

## Checkpoint 1: Understanding the Code
- [ ] You have used GitHub Copilot Chat (`@workspace /explain`) to understand the `process_billing_data` function.
- [ ] You have identified at least 5 major issues in the codebase (e.g., monolithic design, hardcoded values, lack of tests, bugs).

## Checkpoint 2: Building the Test Suite
- [ ] You have created a `tests/` directory.
- [ ] You have written unit tests for the `process_billing_data` function.
- [ ] Your tests cover both successful execution and expected failure modes.
- [ ] All tests pass before you begin refactoring.

## Checkpoint 3: Refactoring the Monolith
- [ ] The data loading logic has been moved to a separate module.
- [ ] The data validation and cleaning logic has been extracted into its own functions.
- [ ] The billing calculation logic is separated from I/O and data manipulation.
- [ ] The reporting logic has been moved to a dedicated reporting module.
- [ ] The `process_billing_data` function is now a coordinator that calls other, smaller functions.

## Checkpoint 4: Improving Code Quality
- [ ] Hardcoded file paths and credentials have been replaced with a configuration system.
- [ ] `print()` statements have been replaced with a structured logging framework.
- [ ] The application has robust error handling for file I/O, data parsing, and calculations.
- [ ] Docstrings and type hints have been added to all new functions and modules.

## Checkpoint 5: Fixing Bugs and Vulnerabilities
- [ ] The timezone conversion bug has been fixed.
- [ ] The usage calculation for resetting meters is now correct.
- [ ] The SQL injection vulnerability in the database client has been patched.
- [ ] The insecure use of `pickle` has been addressed.
- [ ] At least 3 other bugs have been identified and fixed.

By the end of these checkpoints, you should have a well-structured, reliable, and maintainable application.
