## Troubleshooting Tips for GitHub Copilot in SQL

- **Copilot not suggesting anything?**
  - Ensure your file type is recognized as SQL (.sql).
  - Check if Copilot is enabled in your IDE.
  - Provide more context: add comments describing your intent, table names, and column names.
  - Start with a `SELECT` statement or a `WITH` clause to give Copilot a starting point.

- **Suggestions are irrelevant or incorrect?**
  - **Refine your comments**: Be more specific about the business goal, required data, calculations, and constraints.
  - **Provide examples**: If you have a specific output format in mind, describe it.
  - **Iterate**: Accept a partial suggestion and then add more comments to guide Copilot for the next part.
  - **Check your schema**: Ensure your schema is correctly defined and accessible (if using a live connection).

- **Copilot generates syntax errors?**
  - **Review the generated code carefully**: Copilot can sometimes make mistakes, especially with complex queries or less common SQL dialects.
  - **Break down complex tasks**: Instead of asking for a huge query at once, break it into smaller, manageable steps (e.g., using CTEs).
  - **Correct and re-prompt**: Fix the error manually and then add a comment explaining the fix or the desired outcome, allowing Copilot to learn.

- **Performance issues with AI-generated queries?**
  - **Analyze query plans**: Use your database's `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand how the query is executed.
  - **Index optimization**: Copilot might not always suggest optimal indexes. Review your schema and add appropriate indexes.
  - **Refactor complex joins/subqueries**: Sometimes, simpler approaches can be more performant. Ask Copilot for alternative ways to achieve the same result.

- **When to accept vs. refine AI suggestions?**
  - **Accept** when the suggestion is accurate, idiomatic, and directly solves the problem.
  - **Refine** when the suggestion is close but needs minor adjustments, or if it's syntactically correct but doesn't meet the business logic precisely.
  - **Discard and re-prompt** when the suggestion is completely off-topic or fundamentally flawed. Try rephrasing your prompt or adding more context.
