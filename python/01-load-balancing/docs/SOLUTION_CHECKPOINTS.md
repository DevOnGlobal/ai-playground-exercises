# Smart Grid Load Balancing System - Solution Checkpoints

This document provides validation steps and success criteria for each task in the Smart Grid Load Balancing System exercise. Use these checkpoints to verify your progress and ensure your implementations are correct.

## General Verification Steps

-   **Run `main.py`**: After completing each task, try running `python main.py` from the `01_load_balancing` directory. Observe the console output for any errors or unexpected behavior. The `main.py` script is designed to integrate all components.
-   **Check Logging Output**: Pay attention to the `INFO` and `WARNING` messages in the console. They provide insights into the system's operation and alert generation.
-   **Review Generated Data**: If a task involves generating or modifying data, inspect the relevant files (e.g., `data/servers.json` if you were to modify it, or any CSV exports).

## Task 1: Grid Infrastructure Data Models

**Objective**: Complete comprehensive Pydantic models with business validation in `src/models/grid_infrastructure.py`, `src/models/power_sources.py`, and `src/models/load_measurements.py`.

**Success Criteria**:
-   **`src/models/grid_infrastructure.py`**:
    -   `GridSegment.get_utilization_percentage()` correctly calculates `(current_load_mw / max_capacity_mw) * 100`.
    -   `GridSegment.is_approaching_capacity()` returns `True` when utilization is `>= safety_threshold_pct`.
    -   `GridTopology.get_segment_by_id()` correctly retrieves a `GridSegment` by its ID.
-   **`src/models/power_sources.py`**:
    -   `PowerSource` model includes `reliability_score`, `cost_per_mwh`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `operational_status`, `startup_time_minutes`, and `weather_dependent` fields.
    -   `current_output_mw` validator prevents output from exceeding `max_capacity_mw`.
    -   `get_cost_per_hour()` method correctly calculates cost.
    -   `is_renewable()` method correctly identifies renewable sources.
-   **`src/models/load_measurements.py`**:
    -   `LoadMeasurement` model correctly parses `timestamp` strings into `datetime` objects.
    -   `load_mw` field is validated to be non-negative.

**Verification Steps**:
1.  Run `python main.py`. Observe the initial loading messages. If there are Pydantic validation errors, address them.
2.  (Optional) Write a small test script or add print statements in `main.py` to instantiate these models with various values (including invalid ones) and verify their behavior.

## Task 2: Data Loading Infrastructure

**Objective**: Complete the data loading foundation with error handling in `src/utils/data_loader.py`.

**Success Criteria**:
-   **`src/utils/data_loader.py`**:
    -   `load_power_sources()` successfully reads `data/power_sources.json` and returns a list of `PowerSource` objects.
    -   `load_measurement_data()` successfully reads `data/sample_load_data.csv`, parses timestamps, validates `load_mw` (non-negative float), and returns a list of `LoadMeasurement` objects.
    -   Both methods include robust error handling for file operations (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `JSONDecodeError`, `ValueError` for invalid data).
    -   `get_current_grid_state()` correctly aggregates data from `load_grid_topology()` and `load_power_sources()` and calculates system-wide metrics.

**Verification Steps**:
1.  Run `python main.py`. Look for messages indicating successful loading of power sources and measurement data.
2.  Temporarily introduce errors in `data/power_sources.json` (e.g., malformed JSON, invalid `max_capacity_mw`) or `data/sample_load_data.csv` (e.g., non-numeric `load_mw`) and verify that `main.py` catches these errors gracefully (e.g., prints an error message and exits, or skips invalid rows).

## Task 3: Load Balancing Business Logic

**Objective**: Implement core load balancing algorithms with clear data context in `src/services/load_balancer.py`.

**Success Criteria**:
-   **`src/services/load_balancer.py`**:
    -   `analyze_grid_capacity()` correctly categorizes segments into 'healthy', 'warning', and 'critical' based on utilization percentages (80% and 90% thresholds).
    -   `calculate_optimal_transfers()` identifies critical segments and proposes transfers to healthy segments, considering `max_transfer_mw` and `power_loss_pct` of transfer paths.
    -   `validate_transfer_feasibility()` correctly checks if a proposed transfer plan adheres to all constraints (e.g., no segment exceeds capacity, path capacity not exceeded).
    -   `optimize_power_source_dispatch()` prioritizes cheaper and renewable sources while meeting demand and maintaining reserve capacity.

**Verification Steps**:
1.  Run `python main.py`. Observe the output for `Critical segments`, `Warning segments`, and `Recommended load transfers`.
2.  Modify `data/grid_topology.json` to create a scenario where `GRID_001` is critical (e.g., increase `current_load_mw` to 145.0) and `GRID_002` has available capacity. Rerun `main.py` and verify that a transfer recommendation is generated.
3.  (Advanced) Add print statements within the load balancing methods to inspect intermediate calculations and ensure business rules are being applied correctly.

## Task 4: Monitoring and Alerting System

**Objective**: Build real-time monitoring with alert generation in `src/services/monitoring_system.py`.

**Success Criteria**:
-   **`src/services/monitoring_system.py`**:
    -   `generate_capacity_alerts()` correctly creates alerts with appropriate `alert_level` (WARNING, CRITICAL, EMERGENCY) based on segment utilization (80%, 90%, 95% thresholds).
    -   `check_all_segments()` integrates with the data loader and calls `generate_capacity_alerts()`.
    -   Alerts are logged with `logging.warning` and include segment ID, utilization, level, and recommended action.
    -   `track_alert_history()` maintains a record of all generated alerts.
    -   `create_operational_summary()` provides an accurate overview of grid status, including alert breakdown.

**Verification Steps**:
1.  Run `python main.py`. Observe the logging output for `Capacity alert` messages. Adjust `current_load_mw` in `data/grid_topology.json` to trigger different alert levels (e.g., 140.0 for WARNING, 145.0 for CRITICAL, 149.0 for EMERGENCY on `GRID_001`).
2.  Verify that the `Daily Performance Summary Report` (printed at the end of `main.py`) includes an accurate count of active alerts.

## Task 5: Data Analysis and Reporting

**Objective**: Generate operational reports using built-in Python capabilities in `src/reports/grid_reports.py`.

**Success Criteria**:
-   **`src/reports/grid_reports.py`**:
    -   `generate_daily_performance_summary()` produces a well-formatted text report including overall system metrics, segment utilization summary, load pattern analysis, active alerts summary, and recommendations.
    -   `calculate_efficiency_metrics()` correctly calculates overall grid utilization and (placeholder for) power loss.
    -   `analyze_power_source_utilization()` correctly summarizes utilization by source type.
    -   `create_capacity_trend_report()` leverages `data_processor` to provide trend analysis.
    -   `export_data_to_csv()` successfully writes data to a CSV file with specified headers.

**Verification Steps**:
1.  Run `python main.py`. Review the `Daily Performance Summary Report` printed to the console. Ensure all sections are populated and data looks reasonable.
2.  (Optional) Add a call to `grid_reports.export_data_to_csv()` in `main.py` with some sample data (e.g., `monitoring_system.track_alert_history()`) and verify that a CSV file is created in the `data/` directory with the correct content.

By successfully completing these checkpoints, you will have built a functional Smart Grid Load Balancing System and demonstrated strong AI collaboration skills with GitHub Copilot!
