# Legacy Code Refactoring: Energy Meter Pipeline

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Energy Meter Pipeline refactoring exercise. This project simulates a real-world scenario where you are tasked with improving a legacy codebase responsible for processing energy meter readings and generating billing reports.

The initial state of the project is a single, monolithic script that is difficult to maintain, test, and extend. It contains numerous bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.

## Your Mission
Your mission is to refactor this legacy pipeline into a modern, robust, and well-structured application. You will need to apply software engineering best practices to improve its quality, reliability, and maintainability.

## Key Objectives
1.  **Analyze the Codebase:** Understand the existing code and identify its flaws.
2.  **Build a Test Suite:** Create a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the refactored code behaves as expected.
3.  **Refactor the Monolith:** Break down the large, complex functions into smaller, single-responsibility modules.
4.  **Fix Bugs and Vulnerabilities:** Identify and resolve the numerous issues hidden in the codebase.
5.  **Improve Code Quality:** Implement proper configuration management, logging, error handling, and documentation.

## Getting Started
1.  Review the `SETUP_GUIDE.md` to prepare your development environment.
2.  Use the `SOLUTION_CHECKPOINTS.md` to guide your progress through the exercise.
3.  Consult the `COPILOT_TIPS.md` for advice on how to use AI assistance effectively.

Good luck!
