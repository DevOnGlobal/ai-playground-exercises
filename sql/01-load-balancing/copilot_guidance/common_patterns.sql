-- Step 1: Basic query structure
SELECT segment_id, current_load_mw FROM current_grid_status;

-- Step 2: Add business calculations  
-- "Add utilization percentage calculation and safety threshold comparison"

-- Step 3: Include business logic
-- "Add alert status categorization: CRITICAL, WARNING, HEALTHY based on thresholds"

-- Step 4: Refine output format
-- "Order by utilization percentage descending, include last update timestamp"
